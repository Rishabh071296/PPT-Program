Q.4 What is the use of MongoDB?+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ans: MongoDB is a database that can handle lots of different types of data, like user information or product details. It's good for storing and managing large amounts of data and can be set up to work even if some of the computers storing the data stop working. It's flexible and doesn't need a strict structure for the data. MongoDB can also do special things like work with location-based data and make it easy for programmers to work with.
