Q.1 Explain Middlewares in NodeJS ?+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ans: Middlewares in Node.js are a series of functions executed sequentially during the processing of an HTTP request.
They have access to the request and response objects and can modify them or pass control to the next middleware.
Middlewares can handle tasks such as request parsing, authentication, logging, error handling, and more.
They provide a modular and organized way to add functionality to an application.
Error-handling middlewares can catch and process errors or pass them to the next error-handling middleware.
