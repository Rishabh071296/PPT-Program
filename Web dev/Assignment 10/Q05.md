Q.5  What is Mongoose and how does it relate to MongoDB?+++++++++++++

Ans: Mongoose is a library that helps developers work with MongoDB in a more organized and simplified way. It provides a structure called schemas to define how data should be stored in the database. Developers can create models based on these schemas, which serve as interfaces to perform operations like adding, updating, and retrieving data. Mongoose also offers features like middleware and hooks for additional processing, and it supports complex querying and population of related data. With Mongoose, developers can easily validate and transform data before storing it in MongoDB.
